<TITLE>U.S. HOUSE CALLS HIGHER JAPAN DEFENSE SPENDING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House today supported a call for
Japan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden of
protecting Western interests in sensitive areas around the
world, including in the Gulf.
    House member approved a measure that would require
Secretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japan
on increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct of
its gross national product.
    The measure, passed during consideration of the 1988-89
State Department funding bill would not require an increase,
but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense. The
Senate must approve the measure before it becomes law.
    "We don't have to bash the Japanese. We have to show them
how to share the burden of the defense of the free world," said
Rep. Robert Dornan, a California Republican.
    The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks with
Japan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of two
alternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP on
defense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to the
United States as a kind of security fee.

<TITLE>AUSTRALIA SET TO GROW, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, June 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Australia's economy should manage modest
growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but
unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross
Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct
in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be
helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand
following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.
    The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer
prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.
    The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly
and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,
however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth
forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.
    The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic
growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is
struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.
    The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,
should again show growth over the next two years, rising by
0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.

<TITLE>SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    BY MARJORIE SHAFFER, REUTERS</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Robert Fildes, president and chief
executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp
is not interested in buying Cetus.
    Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
    "This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
majority holder in Cetus," Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
"Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
of arrangement," said Fildes.
    Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
by Fildes.
    Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>
and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
    Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
    Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement 
an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
new biotechnology products in several fields.
   
    As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
not in North American and Western Europe.
    "We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
North America and Europe," said Fildes.
    He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
own in that market.
   
    Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
business. Many large corporations have invested in small
biotech firms.
    But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
with a large number of other biotechnology companies."
   
    Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to "keep the
biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves."
    Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
markets.
    Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
over the next five years.
   
    "Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
development to make it happen, while the equity position part
of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
partnership," said Fildes.

<TITLE>FORMER SHEARSON &lt;SHE> OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mark Stahl, 45, who was a former senior
vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers, until his
suspension on April 16, today admitted in U.S. District court
here, embezzling almost 19 mln dlrs from his firm over the past
year.
    He entered a guilty plea before United States District
Court Judge Vincent Broderick to four specific charges totaling
1,031,000 dlrs on wire fraud.
    Stahl, who was a senior vice president for finance, told
the judge that the total embezzlement amounted to "a little
less than" 19 mln dlrs.
   
    Through an attorney, Stahl agreed to make restitution to
Shearson Lehman of all the embezzled funds if possible. However
his guilty pleas today to the four counts will cover all
criminal liability of the embezzlement that occurred between
April 1986 to last April.
    Judge Broderick scheduled sentencing for December nine.
    Stahl faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail and one
mln dlrs in fines, or both.
